# Rollercoaster Ride Eligibility & Billing System

This is a beginner-friendly Python program that simulates a simple ticketing system for a rollercoaster ride. It checks the user's height and age to determine if they are eligible to ride and calculates the ticket price accordingly. The user can also choose whether they want a photo taken, which adds an extra cost to the final bill.

## Features

- Checks if the user is tall enough to ride.
- Calculates ticket prices based on age:
  - Children (age ≤ 12): $5
  - Youth (13–18): $7
  - Adults (age > 25): $12
- Offers optional photo service for an additional $3.
- Displays the final bill based on selected options.
